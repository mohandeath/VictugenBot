FTO single
variations are known to be associated with excess weight, often from childhood. Because you have a single variation, you are 30% more prone to being overweight than people without variations.

 
FTO
affects the hypothalamus in the brain, which is a regulator of hunger. People with FTO variations tend to select food with higher energy content (more calories) and which are typically high in saturated fat and sugar.

Carriers of single variants are shown to have 1.3 times higher risk of type II diabetes.

 
The more
saturated fat you consume, the more the FTO gene sends messages to consume more food and the poorer your sense of satiety becomes. This leads to an even greater sense of hunger. The FTO gene is also associated with having less energy and a lower desire to 
exercise.

 

Typical effects of FTO variations:

 
- Tendency to be overweight
-More hunger, less satiety


- Less willingness to exercise
    
- Having less energy
   
- More inclined to choose saturated fat and sugar


- Very self-reinforcing ‚Äì the unhealthier food you have the more you crave

 
If you wish to ‚Äúturn off‚Äù the FTO variation, you should:


 
*    Consume less than 10 grams of saturated fat daily. It is beneficial to have a low-fat diet, but even better to follow a Mediterranean-style diet to lose weight most effectively.

*    
Eat dairy products (cheese, butter, cream etc.) with caution.  These are particularly high in saturated fats and should be avoided. If you use milk, use skimmed milk.
*    
Eat regularly and eat a balanced diet.

     If your body‚Äôs nutritional demands are met, you should feel less prone to urgent hunger pangs and overeating. 
*    
Exercise regularly!

     There is a correlation between muscle mass and counteracting your FTO variations. Regular exercise will help you counteract the gene variation, burn calories, assist your metabolism and help you to reduce your weight, especially when you have a variation in FTO rs9939609.

        'AA': '''You have probably had a tendency to be overweight from an early age.

FTO double
variations are known to be associated with excess weight, often from childhood. Because you have a double variation, you are 70% more prone to being overweight than people without 
variations.
Carriers of the double variants have shown a 1.6 times higher risk of developing type II diabetes.
